## Anatomy of an SQL query

These are the common clauses of an SQL query:

```sql
SELECT <expressions>
FROM <tables>
JOIN <to other table> ON <join condition>
WHERE <predicates>
GROUP BY <expressions>
HAVING <predicate>
ORDER BY <expressions>
LIMIT <number of rows>
```

Order of execution
The SQL clauses described above are written in that particular order, but surprisingly enough, the database is not executing them in this order.

Instead, the database executes SQL queries in the following order:

- FROM: It finds the tables to access and apply joins in the JOIN clause.
- WHERE: It applies predicates and filters the results.
- SELECT: It finds columns and evaluates expressions.
- GROUP BY: It groups the data and calculates aggregates.
- HAVING: It applies conditions on the calculated aggregates from the previous step.
- ORDER BY: Itâ€™s ordering the result set.
- LIMIT: It restricts the number of rows in the result.
