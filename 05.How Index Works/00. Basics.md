### PostgreSQL index types

There are six types of PostgreSQL indexes, which are also called methods, because they define the way each particular index handles its task. They also determine the syntax specifics. These six types are as follows:

- B-Tree
- Hash
- Generalized Inverted Index (GIN)
- Generalized Search Tree (GiST)
- SP-GiST
- Block Range Index (BRIN)

ðŸ‘‰ **B-Tree is the default index type for the CREATE INDEX command in PostgreSQL**

ðŸ‘‰ **Index is by default created on a Primary key and on unique constraint**

### When should indexes be avoided?
One more thing before we proceed to the CREATE INDEX command: although indexes are meant to improve database performance, there are cases when they can slow it down and thus should best be avoided:

- You should not use indexes on small tables.
- You should not use indexes on tables that face large and frequent batch UPDATE and INSERT operations.
- You should not use indexes on columns that have many NULL values.
- You should not use indexes on columns that are frequently edited.
