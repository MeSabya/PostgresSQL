## Difference between order by and group by clause in SQL

### Order By:
Order by keyword sort the result-set either in ascending or in descending order. This clause sorts the result-set in ascending order by default. In order to sort the result-set in descending order DESC keyword is used.

### Group By :
Group by statement is used to group the rows that have the same value. It is often used with aggregate functions for example:AVG(), MAX(), COUNT(), MIN() etc.

#### Example1:

Write an SQL query to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.

The sold products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.

Return the result table ordered by sell_date.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

```sql
Input: 
Activities table:
+------------+------------+
| sell_date  | product     |
+------------+------------+
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone  |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil     |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt    |
+------------+------------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
```

Explanation: 

For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
For 2020-06-02, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.
