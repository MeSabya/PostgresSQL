## Aggregate Functions
ðŸ‘‰ The aggregate function could be AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, or SUM.

### How to Use the AVG() Aggregate Function
The AVG() aggregate function gets the total number of data and calculates their average.

#### I was able to get the average wage paid to the employees this way:

```sql
SELECT AVG(wage) 
FROM employees
```

#### The query below gets the average wage of junior developers:

```sql
SELECT AVG(wage) 
FROM employees
WHERE role = "Junior dev"
```

### How to use the AVG() Function with GROUP BY and HAVING

#### For instance, I was able to get the average wage paid to employees in each row with this query

```sql
SELECT role, AVG(wage) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY role
```
#### I was also able to get the average wage of senior developers by using the HAVING statement

```sql
SELECT role, AVG(wage) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY role
HAVING role = "Senior dev"
```

### How to Use COUNT() with GROUP BY and HAVING

####  I was able to get the total number of employees in each row with the GROUP BY clause
```sql
SELECT role, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY role
```

### How to Use MAX() with GROUP BY and HAVING

To get the maximum wage in each role, the GROUP BY clause comes in handy:

```sql
SELECT role, MAX(wage) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY role
```

### How to Use SUM() with GROUP BY and HAVING
To get the sum of the total wages paid for employees in each role, I selected the role, used SUM() on the wages, and grouped them by the role:

```sql
SELECT role, SUM(wage) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY role
```

## Having vs Where Clause in SQL
The difference between the having and where clause in SQL is that the where clause cannot be used with aggregates, but the having clause can.

The where clause works on rowâ€™s data, not on aggregated data.
