## PostgreSQL â€“ Joins

A PostgreSQL Join statement is used to combine data or rows from one(self-join) or more tables based on a common field between them. These common fields are generally the Primary key of the first table and Foreign key of other tables.
There are 4 basic types of joins supported by PostgreSQL, namely:

1. Inner Join
2. Left Join
3. Right Join
4. Full Outer Join

### SELF JOIN
The SELF JOIN in SQL, as its name implies, is used to join a table to itself. This means that each row in a table is joined to itself and every other row in that table.

SELF JOIN syntax
To perform a SELF JOIN in SQL, the LEFT or INNER JOIN is usually used.

```sql
SELECT
    column_names
FROM
    Table1 t1
[INNER | LEFT]  JOIN Table1 t2 ON
    join_predicate; 
```
                              
Note: t1 and t2 are different table aliases for the same table.

You can also create the SELF JOIN with the help of the WHERE clause.

```sql
SELECT 
    column_names
FROM 
    Table1 t1, Table1 t2
WHERE 
    condition;
```

Table: Weather

```sql
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```

id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write an SQL query to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Weather table:

```sql
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
```

```sql
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
```

Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
Select w1.id 
from Weather w1,Weather w2
where datediff(w1.recordDate,w2.recordDate)=1 and w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
```
