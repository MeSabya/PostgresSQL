## PostgreSQL â€“ Joins

A PostgreSQL Join statement is used to combine data or rows from one(self-join) or more tables based on a common field between them. These common fields are generally the Primary key of the first table and Foreign key of other tables.
There are 4 basic types of joins supported by PostgreSQL, namely:

1. Inner Join
2. Left Join
3. Right Join
4. Full Outer Join
