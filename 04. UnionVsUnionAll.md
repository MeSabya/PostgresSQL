## Difference Between UNION and UNION ALL

UNION and UNION ALL in SQL are used to retrieve data from two or more tables. 
UNION returns distinct records from both the table, while UNION ALL returns all the records from both the tables.

The result set of UNION does not contain duplicate rows, while the result set of UNION ALL returns all the rows from both tables.
The execution time of UNION ALL is less than the execution time of UNION as it does not removes the duplicate rows.
