## PostgreSQL â€“ IF Statement

PostgreSQL has an IF statement executes `statements` if a condition is true. If the condition evaluates to false, the control is passed to the next statement after the END IF part.

Syntax:

```sql
IF condition THEN
   statements;
END IF;
```

### Example of IF 
Table: Triangle

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |
| z           | int  |
+-------------+------+
(x, y, z) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains the lengths of three line segments.
 

Write an SQL query to report for every three line segments whether they can form a triangle.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Triangle table:
+----+----+----+
| x  | y  | z  |
+----+----+----+
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
+----+----+----+
Output: 
+----+----+----+----------+
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
+----+----+----+----------+
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
+----+----+----+----------+

#### Answer 
To do this, we need to check if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If this condition holds true for all three combinations of sides, then we can say that a triangle can be formed. Otherwise, it means the sides cannot form a triangle.

SELECT *, IF(x+y>z and y+z>x and z+x>y, "Yes", "No") as triangle FROM Triangle
