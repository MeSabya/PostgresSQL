## Grouping

```sql
CREATE TABLE emp AS 
    SELECT * 
    FROM (VALUES
        ('Haki',    'R&D',      'Manager',   10000),
        ('Dan',     'R&D',      'Developer', 7000),
        ('Jax',     'R&D',      'Developer', 7500),
        ('George',  'Sales',    'Manager',   8500),
        ('Bill',    'Sales',    'Developer', 8000),
        ('David',   'Sales',    'Developer', 8000)
    ) AS t(
        name,       dejpartment,  role,       salary
    );

SELECT * FROM emp;
```

### Question1: To count the number of employees in each department, we can use the GROUP BY clause.

```sql
SELECT 
    department, 
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_employees
FROM
    emp
GROUP BY 
    department;
```
### Question2: Calculate the Maximum and Avg salary per department 

```sql
SELECT 
    department, 
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_employees,
    MAX(salary) AS max_salary,
    AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM
    emp
GROUP BY 
    department;
 ```
 ### Question3: Get the first letter of each employee's name
 
 ```sql
 SELECT name, substring(name, 1, 1) AS initial FROM emp;
 ```

**Output:**
 ```sql
name	   initial
Haki	    H
Dan	      D
Jax	      J
George    G
Bill	    B
David	    D
```

### Question4: Count the initials of each name 

```sql
SELECT 
    substring(name, 1, 1) AS initial,
    COUNT(*) 
FROM 
    emp
GROUP BY
    initial;
```

```sql
initi      count
J	           1
D	           2
H	           1
B	           1
G	           1
```
